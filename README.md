Python is an object-oriented language 

## Output
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

To output, we use `print()` 

## Comment
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over 

To use comments, we use `# COMMENT` for single-line

We use `'''COMMENT'''` for block comments

## Data types
We will be working with 5 main data types

1. integer (int) - whole numbers
2. character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. string (str) - collection of characters
4. floating point (float) - decimal numbers

   `my name = " hao "` --> not allowed
3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to separate words `myFirstName or my_first_name `
4.
